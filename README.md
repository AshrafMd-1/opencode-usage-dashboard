# OpenCode Usage Dashboard

A self-hosted dashboard for OpenCode usage trends. A Node.js collector retrieves all paginated usage records, stores them in PostgreSQL, and refreshes a [Rill](https://github.com/rilldata/rill) dashboard backed by DuckDB. Rill AI is configured to use your OpenAI-compatible provider.

```text
OpenCode → collector → PostgreSQL → Rill/DuckDB → dashboard
```

The stack supports Linux ARM64 (`aarch64`) and AMD64. It is intended for Docker on Ubuntu 24.04 and also works with Docker Desktop.

## Dashboard contents

The **OpenCode Usage** dashboard provides time trends and comparisons for:

- requests and estimated API cost in USD
- input, output, reasoning, cache-read, and cache-write tokens
- total input/cache and total token volume
- average estimated API cost per request and cache-read ratio
- model, provider, plan, API key display name, workspace, and session dimensions
- today, week/month to date, 7-day, 30-day, 3-month, all-time, and custom ranges

Quota/reset data is intentionally not included because it has a different data grain. Cost values are source-reported estimates normalized to USD; they are not verified invoices or account charges.

## Rill AI provider

Rill uses the configured OpenAI-compatible endpoint for its AI features. The provider is selected by `ai_connector: openai` in `rill/rill.yaml`, and `rill/connectors/openai.yaml` reads its settings from environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — provider credential;
- `OPENAI_BASE_URL` — OpenAI-compatible API root, usually ending in `/v1`;
- `OPENAI_MODEL` — exact model identifier accepted by the provider.

Keep the real values only in the root `.env` file. The connector YAML is safe to commit because it contains environment-variable references rather than credentials. Compose passes the values to the Rill runtime; the collector and PostgreSQL do not receive them.

The endpoint must implement the OpenAI API behavior expected by Rill. A provider describing itself as OpenAI-compatible may still differ in supported models, request fields, tool use, or response formats.

After changing the provider, key, URL, or model, recreate Rill:

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate rill
```

Provider configuration controls where Rill sends AI requests. Dashboard queries and metrics remain governed by the `opencode_usage` metrics view.

## Requirements

- Docker Engine with the Compose plugin
- an OpenCode workspace usage URL
- the workspace's secret `auth` cookie
- an API key, base URL, and model name for an OpenAI-compatible AI provider

No local Node.js or Rill installation is required.

## Setup

1. Create local configuration:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and set at least:

   ```dotenv
   OPENCODE_USAGE_URL=https://opencode.ai/workspace/<workspace-id>/usage
   OPENCODE_AUTH=<raw-auth-cookie-value>
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<long-random-password>
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<provider-api-key>
   OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://your-provider.example.com/v1
   OPENAI_MODEL=<provider-model-name>
   ```

3. Build and start:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

4. Follow startup:

   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f collector rill
   ```

5. Open:

   - controls: <http://localhost:3000>
   - dashboard: <http://localhost:9009>

The initial collector run performs a complete OpenCode refetch. Existing PostgreSQL volumes use incremental refreshes.

## Refresh behavior

A refresh has two stages:

1. the collector fetches OpenCode records and upserts them into PostgreSQL;
2. it asks Rill to reload the `opencode_usage` model into DuckDB.

The controls page offers:

- **Refresh now** — run the complete pipeline;
- **Retry Rill only** — reload Rill after PostgreSQL succeeded but Rill was unavailable;
- **Enable/disable auto-refresh** — persisted in PostgreSQL.

Auto-refresh defaults to every 6 hours. `AUTO_REFRESH_ENABLED` initializes a new database only; afterward, the controls-page setting is authoritative. Dashboard filter changes merely re-query data already loaded into Rill.

The incremental collector preserves the five-sequential-request fingerprint overlap. A healthy no-change run normally fetches only the first 50-row OpenCode page. If no overlap is found, it safely scans all pages and upserts by fingerprint.

Each refresh also retrieves the workspace key directory returned by OpenCode's monthly usage loader. Rill displays its friendly key names while PostgreSQL retains key IDs only as stable join values. Deleted keys remain named for historical usage. If OpenCode changes that internal loader, request collection still succeeds and the controls page reports the key-name enrichment warning; `OPENCODE_KEY_METADATA_SERVER_ID` can temporarily override the loader ID.

## Security

`OPENCODE_AUTH` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are live credentials. Never commit, print, or share `.env`. Do not put the AI key directly in `rill/connectors/openai.yaml`, `compose.yaml`, screenshots, logs, or issue reports.

Compose binds both web ports only to loopback:

```text
127.0.0.1:3000
127.0.0.1:9009
```

PostgreSQL has no published host port. **Rill Preview is not an authentication boundary.** Protect the public dashboard with Cloudflare Access. Keep the collector controls private unless they are separately protected, and never assign a public domain to PostgreSQL.

## Deploy on Coolify with Cloudflare Access

This is the simplest production path for an ARM64 Ampere server. `Dockerfile.rill` automatically downloads the ARM64 Rill release, and the named PostgreSQL and Rill volumes persist across Coolify redeployments.

1. Push this repository to GitHub. The repository may be public because tracked files contain no credentials; keep all real values in Coolify runtime secrets and never commit `.env`.
2. In Coolify, create a **Docker Compose** resource from that repository and select `compose.yaml`.
3. Add these environment variables in Coolify. Mark `OPENCODE_AUTH`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY` as runtime secrets, not build-only values. Leave Coolify's **Use Docker Build Secrets** option disabled: these values are not needed during image builds, and Dockerfile rewriting is unnecessary for this multi-service Compose project.

   ```dotenv
   OPENCODE_USAGE_URL=https://opencode.ai/workspace/<workspace-id>/usage
   OPENCODE_AUTH=<raw-auth-cookie-value>
   # Optional only if OpenCode changes its internal key-metadata loader:
   OPENCODE_KEY_METADATA_SERVER_ID=
   POSTGRES_DB=opencode_usage
   POSTGRES_USER=opencode
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<long-random-password>
   AUTO_REFRESH_ENABLED=true
   AUTO_REFRESH_INTERVAL_MINUTES=360
   RILL_INTERNAL_URL=http://rill:9009
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<provider-api-key>
   OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://your-provider.example.com/v1
   OPENAI_MODEL=<provider-model-name>
   RILL_VERSION=0.87.8
   ```

4. Assign only the Rill service a domain in Coolify: `https://usage.example.com:9009`. Rill's container port is **9009**, not 9000. The suffix tells Coolify to proxy the container's internal port 9009; visitors still use normal HTTPS on port 443. Do not assign domains to `collector` or `postgres`, and do not open ports 3000, 9009, or 5432 in the server's public firewall.
5. In Cloudflare DNS, point the dashboard hostname to the Coolify server and enable the orange-cloud proxy. Use **Full (strict)** TLS.
6. In **Cloudflare Zero Trust → Access controls → Applications**, create a self-hosted application for the dashboard hostname. Add an **Allow** policy containing only your Google account and enable Google as the identity provider. Access denies all unmatched users by default.
7. Deploy, then verify the protected dashboard, service health, and the first collector refresh.

The intended production exposure is:

```text
Internet → Cloudflare Access → Coolify proxy → rill:9009
SSH tunnel → server loopback:3000 → collector controls
collector → PostgreSQL → Rill
```

The six-hour scheduler makes public collector controls unnecessary. Leave the collector without a Coolify domain. The controls page has no application-level login and relies on the loopback binding plus SSH for its security boundary. When manual controls are needed, run this command on your local computer and keep the terminal open:

```bash
ssh -N -L 13000:127.0.0.1:3000 ubuntu@SERVER_IP
```

Then open <http://localhost:13000>. From that private controls page you can run **Refresh now**, **Retry Rill only**, or enable/disable automatic refresh. Closing the SSH command removes local access. Port 13000 is only the local end of the tunnel; the collector continues to use port 3000 on the server.

For shell-level maintenance, use Coolify's terminal for the Compose resource, or SSH to the server and change to the application's deployment directory before running `docker compose` commands. Prefer the controls page for ordinary refresh operations. Never run `docker compose down -v` unless you intentionally want to erase PostgreSQL and Rill volumes.

The Compose host-port mappings bind only to `127.0.0.1`, while Coolify's proxy reaches Rill over its private Docker network. This avoids exposing ports 3000 or 9009 directly. Cloudflare Access protects requests arriving through Cloudflare; to prevent origin bypass, restrict origin traffic to Cloudflare IP ranges or publish through a Cloudflare Tunnel.

### Updating the Coolify deployment

1. Commit and push changes to the configured GitHub branch.
2. In Coolify, open the Compose resource and choose **Redeploy**. Automatic deployments may be enabled if preferred.
3. Wait for `postgres`, `collector`, and `rill` to become healthy.
4. Open the protected dashboard and verify the latest collector run through the SSH-tunneled controls page when needed.

Normal rebuilds and redeployments preserve the named PostgreSQL and Rill volumes. Changing a Coolify environment variable requires a redeploy. Removing the resource, deleting its persistent volumes, or running `docker compose down -v` can permanently remove stored data.

## Operations

### Status and logs

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=200 collector
docker compose logs --tail=200 rill
docker compose logs --tail=200 postgres
```

### Validate PostgreSQL totals

```bash
docker compose exec postgres psql -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB" -c \
  'SELECT COUNT(*) AS requests, SUM(cost_usd) AS cost_usd FROM usage_requests;'
```

If those shell variables are not exported, use the values from `.env` directly.

### Stop or restart

```bash
docker compose stop
docker compose restart collector rill
```

### Backup

```bash
docker compose exec -T postgres pg_dump -U "$POSTGRES_USER" "$POSTGRES_DB" > opencode-usage.sql
```

The dump contains usage metadata such as workspace/session/key IDs. Store it securely.

Restore into an empty database with `psql` after recreating the stack.

### Reset all stored data

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build -d
```

**Warning:** `down -v` permanently deletes PostgreSQL history, refresh settings, and Rill runtime state. The next start performs a full OpenCode refetch.

### Upgrade Rill

Rill is pinned to `v0.87.8`. `Dockerfile.rill` contains the official SHA-256 digest for each AMD64/ARM64 release archive. To upgrade:

1. change the version;
2. obtain both archive digests from the official GitHub release;
3. update both checksum build arguments;
4. rebuild with `docker compose build --no-cache rill`;
5. run the verification steps below.

Changing only `RILL_VERSION` intentionally causes the image build to fail checksum verification.

## ARM64 verification

On the Ubuntu host:

```bash
uname -m
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

`uname -m` should report `aarch64`. The Rill Dockerfile maps Docker's `arm64` target to the signed `rill_linux_arm64.zip` release and does not require emulation.

Confirm published bindings:

```bash
docker compose port collector 3000
docker compose port rill 9009
```

Both should report `127.0.0.1`.

## Troubleshooting

### Collector reports HTTP 401/403

The OpenCode cookie has likely expired. Replace `OPENCODE_AUTH` in `.env`, then recreate the collector:

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate collector
```

Existing PostgreSQL and dashboard data remain available.

### OpenCode bundle discovery fails

OpenCode may have changed its internal SolidStart assets or `usage.list` reference. Check sanitized collector logs. Do not paste cookies or raw `.env` contents into an issue.

### PostgreSQL schema is missing after editing `postgres/init.sql`

Initialization scripts run only for a new PostgreSQL volume. Apply a migration manually or reset the volume after taking a backup.

### PostgreSQL refreshed but Rill did not

Use **Retry Rill only** on <http://localhost:3000>. Then inspect:

```bash
docker compose logs --tail=200 rill collector
```

### Rill AI provider fails

Confirm that `OPENAI_BASE_URL` includes the provider's required API prefix (commonly `/v1`) and that `OPENAI_MODEL` exactly matches a model exposed by that endpoint. After correcting `.env`, recreate only Rill:

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate rill
docker compose logs --tail=200 rill
```

An HTTP 401/403 generally indicates an invalid key or provider-side permissions. An unknown-model response indicates a model-name mismatch. Protocol or unsupported-field errors can mean the endpoint is not sufficiently OpenAI-compatible for Rill.

Never paste the API key or complete `.env` contents into logs, commands, or issue reports.

### Rill starts with a YAML/model error

Run:

```bash
docker compose exec rill rill project status --local
```

Then inspect the Rill logs and the files under `rill/`.

## Development

Run unit tests locally:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

Validate Compose interpolation without starting services:

```bash
docker compose config --quiet
```
